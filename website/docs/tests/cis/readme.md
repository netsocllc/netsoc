# CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark

## Overview

The tests in this section verifies that a Microsoft 365 tenant's configuration conforms to the [CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_365) recommendations (v3.1.0).

The CIS published material is shared for these tests as it aligns with their licensing of [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/terms-and-conditions-table-of-contents).

## Connecting to Azure, Exchange and other services

In order to run all the CIS tests, you need to install and connect to the Azure and Exchange Online modules.

See the [Installation guide](/docs/installation#optional-modules-and-permissions) for more information.

## Tests

It is important to note that a number of the policy checks ONLY check the default policy, and not every policy. CIS 2.1.7 `Test-MtCisSafeAntiPhishingPolicy` is one example.

:::info
TBD in this case refers to CIS "manual" checks. It might be possible to automate these, but skipping for now to focus on automated checks.
