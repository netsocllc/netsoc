## What's new since March v0.1.0

It’s taken a whole village to bring you **Maester v1**. 🌟 Here are some of the highlights:

### 🧪 **New Tests**
We've almost doubled the number of tests, growing from 96 to 194! 🎉 Check out the [test list](https://github.com/maester365/maester/blob/main/docs/tests.md) for the full breakdown. Special mentions go to:
- [**Mike**](https://github.com/soulemike) – Mike started adding [CISA tests](/docs/tests/cisa/entra) to Maester the very next day after Maester was unveiled at the PowerShell conference. 🚀 Since then, he’s been instrumental in contributing code, replying to issues on GitHub, and engaging on Discord. Maester wouldn’t be where it is today without him. Thank you, Mike! 🙌
- [**Ben**](https://github.com/NZLostboy) – Ben took the initiative to add [CIS benchmark tests](/docs/tests/cis/) and is now our #6 highest contributor. Thanks, Ben, for the tremendous value you've brought to Maester! 💪

### 🤖 **Maester GitHub Action**
[**Fabian**](https://github.com/f-bader) built the [Maester - GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/maester-action), simplifying the setup and running of Maester on GitHub. He completed this just in time for the [PowerShell Conference Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGXExUmwmBQ). Thank you, Fabian! 👏

### 🛡️ **Entra ID - Security Config Analyzer Updates**
[**Thomas**](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt) has done phenomenal work keeping Maester updated with [EIDSCA](/docs/tests/eidsca/). His vigilance in monitoring Entra ID and adding new security checks has been invaluable in improving the security posture of countless Entra tenants. 🙏

### 📊 **Pester Test & Report Improvements**
A massive shout-out to [**Frode Flaten**](https://github.com/fflaten) for refactoring the Maester codebase and elevating it to new heights. 🚀 From enhancing performance for PSScriptAnalyzer to improving test reports with filtering and tag support, Frode has made Maester run smoother and more efficiently. Thank you, Frode! 🌟

### 🛠️ **New & Improved Test Folder Installation**
